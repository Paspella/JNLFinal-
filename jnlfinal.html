<p>Children can play with toys in many ways: they fiddle with them in their hands, smack them on surfaces, and even throw them across the room. Another place that toy will most likely be is in their mouths. While they explore their new environments and senses, this act can lead to a serious illness. Patric Strodel, a lead tester at Lead Safe LLC, says this is the predominant way children get lead poisoned.</p>

<p> "This (lead) dust settles where they play and where they spend their time," Strodel said, "and they got their hands in their toys, and they put it right in their mouth."</p>

<p> In Syracuse, New York, lead-based paint is used on many houses. As most houses were built decades ago, the paint wears off and deteriorates over time, leaving small dust all over the house. The properties that are most dangerous in town are the rentals built before 1978, according to Dr. Sandra Lane, a lead activist in the community and professor at Syracuse University. Lead dust is created in places of high friction, such as the surfaces of window seals and floors beneath doorways, which are easy places for children to touch. This lead dust not only compromises the surfaces but also gets on the toys that roll around the house.</p>

<p> The older the house is the more paint chips and dust goes unnoticed, and the more children get lead poisoned. The graph above shows the number of tests administered over the past two decades in the State of New York. Lead poisoning has become more on the forefront of parents' minds over the past six years. Dr. Lane says the recent drop in cases as of 2020 has been due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

<p>"It is a child's capacity for learning that is altered by lead." Dr. Lane says, "Lead poisoning robs the children of some of their competence, intellectual competence."</p>

<p>In a study, Dr. Herbert Needleman tested children's teeth to detect lead in children. Instead of putting lost teeth under the pillow for the tooth fairy to find, parents would give the teeth to Needleman, as bones were the most accurate part of the body to find how much lead was in a child's bloodstream.</p>

<p> When toxic lead enters a child's body, it mainly affects the frontal lobe of the brain and the limbic system. The limbic system is mainly in charge of emotional and behavioral responses. This has a major effect on classroom behavior as children get older.</p>

<p>Needleman asked teachers to describe the students he used in his study. There was a direct correlation between children who had levels of lead in their blood system and behavioral issues in class. The study discovered that children with lead poisoning lack attention in class, and therefore do not have a strong understanding of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Dr. Lane worries most about children from ages 1 to 2. If children acquire lead poisoning before they learn to read, the chances of them graduating 8th  grade are challenging. The chances of them graduating high school, even with assisted help, is extremely slim.</p>

<p>"Children are less ready to read, not that they do not care, not that their parents do not care, but their learning is slower." Dr. Lane said. And it's not that they can not learn, and not that they are not absolutely valuable human beings."</p>

<iframe title="Amount of Children with Lead Poisoning in Onondaga County Over the Years (in thousands)" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jUuX3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jUuX3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 75% !important; border: none;" height="451"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<p>Onondaga county has at least 2,000 children every year who obtain lead poisoning. That is over 2,000 children who struggle to understand in the classroom and interact with their peers.</p>

<p>Lane also technically supported a study in Cairo Egypt, where she found that most all average kids lost 5 IQ points to lead poisoning.</p>

<p> "If you have a whole population, which was the case in Kyro, that lost 5 IQ points, Does that have any impact in that society?" Dr. Lane said, "It must."</p>

<p>While lead poisoning does not affect all kids in Syracuse, it is one of the cities that battles this issue the most in the United States, according to Strodel. Dr. Lane is a part of a coalition called Families for Lead Freedom Now that wants to stop lead poisoning's impact on society. This group hosts rallies and writes to city officials, hoping to gain political traction. Their letters call upon politicians to change the laws on lead testing to make it more accessible for families and organizations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no absolute cure to lead exposure. There are a few treatments to reduce some of the symptoms, but no complete fix. Strodel suggests that the only way to prevent a child from getting lead poisoning in homes is to contact a certified contractor who is qualified to remove the dust safely. Using a broom and dustpan or vacuuming would not be effective at all, but disposable wet cleaning methods are ways to reduce the amount of dust.</p>
